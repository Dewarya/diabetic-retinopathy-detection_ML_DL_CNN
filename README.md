# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection with Deep Learning
This archive contains code for a deep learning project designed to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) using convolutional neural networks (CNN).
# Introduction.
Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness among adults. Early detection and treatment are critical for preventing vision loss. In this project, we use deep learning techniques to create a model that can accurately classify retinal images into the various stages of diabetic retinopathy.
# Model Architecture
We investigate a variety of deep learning architectures, including CNN, LSTM, and hybrid CNN-LSTM models. The final model architecture is made up of multiple convolutional layers, followed by LSTM layers for temporal feature extraction.
